## Resources

- [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-au/excel)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source Python library which in simple terms, provides Excel-like programmatic functions to your datasets. To use pandas, familiarity with the [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) library is important as they can be used together.
