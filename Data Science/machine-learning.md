# Machine Learning

## Introduction

Making predictions from data.

## Learning

- Andrew Ng's Machine Learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is free, accessible online is taught from bare-bones.
- This [cheat sheet](https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-science-pdf-f22dc900d2d7) summarises the majority of popular algorithms used in machine learning.

## Resources

- Most popular cloud services have many accessible tools built using machine learning models. Check out [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/).
- [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) allows you to build, train and deploy models quickly.
- For those who do not have access to devices with GPUs, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) allows you to write and run code in the form of a notebook borrowing their GPU power.
- Some open source programming libraries include [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Notes

Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are both applications of machine learning. Check them out for more resources.
