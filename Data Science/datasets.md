# Datasets

Have trouble finding data? I have compiled a list of potentially useful sites to help you find free datasets.

## Resources

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a popular online data science community to share datasets, build and compete with machine learning models, and learn from others.
- [data.world](https://data.world) provides some open data datasets that can be searched [here](https://data.world/datasets/open-data).
- [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) is Google's tool for finding online datasets.
- [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/)
- [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) contains millions of images good for classification or object-detection in computer vision.
- [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home) is an annual computer vision competition that also shares its image dataset with the community.
- [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) consists of millions of images including segmentation, classification and annotation.
- [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) matches research papers with datasets used.
