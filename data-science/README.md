# Data Science

In my perception, Data Science makes use of algorithms \(typically statistical and/or machine learning\) to create insights from data. It requires knowledge in mathematics \(eg, understanding error functions, statistics, linear algebra\), programming \(to develop a pipeline that can clean, parse and run the algorithm on the data\), and some domain knowledge \(ie, data analytics\), to understand the significance of the results.
