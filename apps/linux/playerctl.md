# Playerctl

On my Corsair K55 keyboard, there were extra keys \(AudioStop, AudioPrev, AudioPlay, AudioNext\) that currently did nothing. I wanted to map these keys to do something useful.

Since I listened to music from a range of sources such as Spotify, Youtube Music, Youtube \(on Firefox and Chrome\), I wanted a tool that could allow me to control my media players. I discovered [Playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl).

I incorporated keybindings with Playerctl's commandline commands such that I can press play/pause to automatically play/pause my most recent media player, whether it was Spotify, Youtube Music, or something else. Furthermore, I also made a custom music player widget to show me what song I am currently playing \(along with other metadata\). The details are [here](https://github.com/JimmeeX/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/awesome/my-widgets).
