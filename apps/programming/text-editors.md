For context, I do web application development and data science. When I first started programming, and had no idea what a text editor was, a friend told me to use Sublime Text. From around 0.5-1 years of using Sublime as a newcomer to programming, it was extremely simple and fast. However, it wasn't too feature rich \(I might be wrong here!\), so I decided to switch to Visual Studio Code.

Up until now, I have continued using Visual Studio Code for more than 3 years. It bundles so many features in an easy-to-use intuitive interface. It is easily customisable, and provides the ability to download 3rd party extensions and plugins. It is continuously being updated, and as a result of its popularity, there are so many extensions for various kinds of projects. I have used VS Code for Web Development, App Development, Machine Learning, Data Science, Robotics, and even writing research reports \(LaTeX\). Some of my favourite extensions include

* [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) - To collaborate with other developers on a single project
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - To add in powerful Git capabilities
* [Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) - To edit remote files using SSH
* [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) - Python intellisense, linting, debugging, formatting, etc. One feature I really make use of is Jupyter Notebook support. Instead of having to run my own Jupyter Notebook server which can be tedious, I can just open a \*.ipynb file on VS Code so I can also make use of VS Code's powerful features.
