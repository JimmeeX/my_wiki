# Shell

In terms of shell, there are usually 3 primary choices

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)

I have personally used Bash a little bit, and then discovered and used Zsh and never looked back. I chose to use Zsh because of its incredible customisability and ability to use 3rd party plugins based on what you desire using the power of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). Some of my favourite plugins include

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - which suggests commands based on history and completions.
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - which colours your commands, making it easy to check for syntax errors.

In terms of Zsh theming, I recommend the recent [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). It is incredibly fast and feature-rich (it expands from powerlevel9k), and is so easy to setup. In the past, I have used [powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k), [spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt).
