# Daisy Disk

Daisy Disk is a utility application that provides a beautiful visualisation of your Mac's storage space. It allows you to easily navigate, identify and delete files and folders that you didn't know take up a large portion of storage.

As a Mac user who was constantly running out of storage space due to work, data storage, virtual machines, and many software, I constantly had to resort to Daisy Disk to clean up my storage. I often wish that this software was available to use on other OS such as Windows and Linux.

Daisy Disk has a free trial, and as of writing this wiki, costs $14.99 AUD.

More information can be found in the [official website](https://daisydiskapp.com/).

PS: Daisy Disk is great paired with the free app [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) to fully uninstall software from your Mac.
