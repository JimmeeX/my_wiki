# Digital Colour Meter

Digital Colour Meter is an inbuilt Mac OS app that I find myself regularly using. It is an extremely simple app which retrieves the colour of the pixel on your screen located at your cursor. It is quite similar to the [ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/) Chrome Extension tool.

Some features include

- Displaying the colour in HEX, RGB (and a couple other channels).
- Changing the 'aperture size' at your cursor. Eg, you can check the colour of a single pixel, or the average colour within a 5x5 window.
- Copy colour as text or as image with shortcut.

It is easy to see how this tool can be useful when doing design work. I also found this tool extremely useful when doing computer vision in robotics.
