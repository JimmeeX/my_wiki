Alfred is a macOS launcher that allows you to quickly launch apps, find documents, perform calculations and conversions and much more in a more productive manner. While macOS has Spotlight as the default app capable of this functionality, Alfred provides limitless customisability such as writing your own custom commands (called Workflows), changing the appearance. Furthermore, Alfred can interface with the internet, so it is possible to query results from Google, YouTube, Amazon, Github, etc without actively opening the browser application.

In my personal experience, I find myself unavoidably using Alfred whenever I am on my Macbook. While I do not make use of every possible functionality, there are a select few which can collectivity save a lot of time each day. I have created a few basic Workflows to reduce the manual work I have to do in my day-to-day experience, which can be found [here](https://github.com/JimmeeX/my_alfred_workflows).

Alfred is free to download and use infinitely, and a Powerpack can be purchased to use all available features.
