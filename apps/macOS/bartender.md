# Bartender

Bartender is a very simple tool that allows you to customise your Mac menu bar by removing, hiding or rearranging icons. This is great if you want a clean and minimal desktop.

I personally used Bartender in conjunction with [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) to only show system monitor details for my Mac. Other apps are either hidden or removed from the menu bar based on the frequency that I use them.

The app is free to download and try for a few weeks, but requires a purchase afterwards.

More information can be found in the [official website](https://www.macbartender.com/).
