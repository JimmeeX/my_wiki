# PDF Expert

PDF Expert is a PDF editor application designed for macOS. It allows you to open, read, annotate and edit PDFs.

As a user who has switched from Adobe's PDF editor (Adobe Acrobat Pro or Adobe Acrobat Reader), I can say that my experience in using PDF Expert is much more pleasant. The most noticeable difference is the speed in almost every aspect: from launching the application, opening PDFs to read, and editing, annotating and other features. The UI/UX is much more intuitive and prettier to the eye. Furthermore, I am a big fan of their split view functionality, allowing you to open, read and edit two PDFs at the same time, side-by-side. Additionally, as a dark-theme enthusiast, it is interesting to note that PDF expert allows you to view PDFs in Day, Night or Sepia themes.

PDF Expert is free to download and use, but more all the features, it comes at a hefty price.
