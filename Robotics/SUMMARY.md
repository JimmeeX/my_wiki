I'd like to think of robots as programmable machines that are used to assist our day-to-day lives.

The field of robotics encompasses three main disciplinaries: mechanical engineering (design and construction of the physical robot), electrical engineering (wiring of components to sensors), and software engineering (programming the robot to do something cool).
