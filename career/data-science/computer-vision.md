# Computer Vision

## Introduction

Computer Vision is studying algorithms and methods of giving computers the ability to interpret images and videos as well as humans do. I perceive Computer Vision to branch into 2 main categories: **Traditional Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.

## Learning

While most of my Computer Vision knowledge came from university courses, there were some resources that I definitely found useful to bolster my learning:

* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) documentation and tutorials cover the majority of popular traditional Computer Vision techniques.
* For Deep Learning, Stanford's CS231n course on Convolutional Neural Networks is excellent for understanding deep learning and CNNs. Preliminary basic machine learning is encouraged. I watched the Winter 2016 term available on YouTube as it was taught by world-class AI researcher Andrej Karpathy, accessible [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC). Andrej Karpathy himself writes [blogs](http://karpathy.github.io/) and teaches in a very intuitive and understandable way.

## Tools

* I have primarily used the Python programming language for Computer Vision. C++ is a popular alternative that has a steeper learning curve, but can produce more efficient algorithms.
* For Traditional Computer Vision, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is the most popular library. The [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) library also offers a collection of image algorithms if you cannot find your desired algorithm in OpenCV. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a necessity for fast and efficient matrix operations.
* For Deep Learning, [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is the main bare-bones library to construct and train neural networks for deep learning. Alternatively, there are many abstraction libraries built on top of Tensorflow aimed for quick productivity. I mainly use [Keras](https://keras.io/), but there is also [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Other helpful libraries include [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [CNTK](https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
