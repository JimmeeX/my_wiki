# React

React is a JavaScript library designed to build user interfaces effortlessly. It was released by Facebook in 2013, and continues to be very popular amongst beginners interested in web development due to its huge and active community.

## Learning

Some resources I used when learning React for the first time include:

* [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPT3bFIwJYA&list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS) has a great balance between theory and practical examples to teach React concepts. I really enjoy Academind as they explain concepts well at my ideal pace. Additionally they are extremely experienced web developers and know best practices.
* [Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). While I'm not the best at absorbing concepts just from reading, I found the React documentation to be surprisingly easy to take in.

Being familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS will make learning React a lot more easier!
